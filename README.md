# Flight-Tracker-App

-	Accumulated flight ticket prices from an API to popular destinations from the userâ€™s departing airport
-	Converted a Google Sheet to an API where each destination and respective price were recorded
-	Compared previous data from the Google Sheet with current prices and if they were cheaper, an email notifying the user of a less expensive deal would be automatically sent
